Release new beta version

- feat: support recursive query and recursive query
- feat: allow user to select local binding interface (thanks @LBRDan)
- feat: ui improve
- fix(linux): packageName and icon is not correct
- refactor: adjust the types for pkg category

**PS** When aggregation mode is enabled, the patch and addon files are automatically associated with base file and not displayed in the list, you can view them in the detail page. It is better to use with file server's recursive query mode
